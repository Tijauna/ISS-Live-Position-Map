# ISS-Live-Position-Map

This Python program displays the live position of the International Space Station above a world map, along with additional information such as altitude, velocity and the daylight/night state. As the station moves, its orbital path is traced in real time. The ISS experiences 16 sunrises and sunsets every day, and travels at a speed of over 27000 km/h.
